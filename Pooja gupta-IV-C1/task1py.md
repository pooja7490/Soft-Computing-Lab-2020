Aim: Learning of various environment which can be used for python programming.

Python Interpreter
The Python interpreter translates the high-level language (i.e. Python) into a low-level language that the machine can understand. 
In other words, it reads Python programs and carries out their instructions.

IDLE
Python's default installation also comes with its own IDE called IDLE. 
IDLE initially stood for Integrated DeveLopment Environment, but this is sometimes extended to Integrated Development and Learning Environment. 
IDLE is intended to be a simple IDE, which is suitable for beginners learning Python. 
It includes common IDE features such as auto completion, smart indent, syntax highlighting, debugging, etc. 
IDLE itself is built 100% in Python
